## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course will provide an introduction to Object Oriented programming in Python. Students will get a high level introduction to several concepts that involve Artificial Intelligence. The course is meant to be a bridge between a college level programming 1 and programming 2 course. Class time will include a mix of journaling, group work and group discussion to provide background on programming concepts as well as AI problems and approaches, and lab time to work on in class exercises and the projects themselves. The lab time will be supervised by Mr. Berg. During this time, students may work on their assignments alone, but are also encouraged to work in pairs and groups in order to help their classmates. While the projects are well specified, there is much room for variation by individuals and students are encouraged to continue to extend beyond the scope of the project and be creative.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

* Understand core concepts of Artificial Intelligence
* Create Python programs with an AI focus
* Analyze the ethics of AI and its impact on society
* Apply object-oriented programming principles using Python

## CURRICULUM OUTLINE

## STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

You're responsible for staying on top of project deadlines and requirements. I'll communicate important information through multiple channels (class announcements, Google Classroom, email), but it's on you to stay informed.

I expect you to contribute to a respectful learning environment and be an active participant - ask questions, engage in discussions, and submit quality work. If you're absent or facing challenges, reach out to me. Life happens, and I'm here to help, but communication is key.

## GRADING SCALE

Following the Chicago Public Schools standard:

| **A** 90-100% | **B** 80-89% | **C** 70-79% | **D** 60-69% | **F** 59% and below |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------------:|

## SEMESTER GRADE BREAKDOWN

We use a total points system - everything goes into one category in Aspen. Grades are updated weekly, and I return almost everything digitally. Keep copies of all graded work in case we need to resolve any gradebook issues.

## PROJECT WRITE-UPS

All assignments center around project write-ups, though some grading will include your code as well. **The majority of your grade comes from the write-up** - I'm more interested in what you learn from the process than just getting the program to work. Since any program can be found online these days, demonstrating your understanding through reflection is what matters most.

You'll also complete current events and article reflections. Find interesting AI-related articles and analyze them - I'm looking for thoughtful analysis, not just summaries. I want to see you thinking critically about how AI impacts our lives now and in the future.

## ACCOMMODATIONS FOR DIVERSE LEARNERS

Within the first two weeks, I'll reach out individually to students with 504 Plans or IEPs. If you need accommodations, don't hesitate to contact me - ensuring you get appropriate support is a priority.

## GRADING RUBRIC

Projects use a 0-10 point scale based on proficiency levels:

| **Level** | **Points** | **Percentage** | **Description** |
|-----------|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Mastery** | 10 | 100% | Full mastery demonstrated with complex, quality application |
| **Proficient** | 8.5 | 85% | Near-mastery with few errors or misconceptions |
| **Emerging** | 7.5 | 75% | Understanding is developing; some mistakes present but clear progress |
| **Limited** | 6 | 60% | Honest attempt made; limited understanding evident |
| **No Evidence** | 0 | 0% | Little to no understanding shown or insufficient evidence |

*Strongly recommended: If you earn 7 or below, review, revise, and resubmit your work.*

Partial credit applies - if you start but don't complete an assignment, you'll receive a baseline of 40%. Nothing started = 0 (missing).

## LATE WORK & RESUBMISSION POLICY

Time management is crucial in project-based learning. All deadlines are announced with plenty of lead time, and the workload is designed to be completed during class time - so use your class time wisely!

**Submission Rules:**
- Students who submit by the deadline can resubmit without penalty for up to two weeks
- **Students who initially receive a "missing" grade face a 10% penalty per day** for any submission after the original due date
- Example: If you have a missing assignment and submit 2 days late, maximum possible score is 80%
- You have up to two weeks from the original due date to submit or resubmit
- Email me when you're ready for grading
- Your new score (minus any applicable late penalties) replaces the original
- After two weeks, no submissions will be accepted

**Special Circumstances:**
For absences due to illness, quarantine, or other excused circumstances, contact me to arrange alternative timelines without penalties.

Students at risk of earning a D or F will meet with me and a parent/guardian to develop a recovery plan.

## TURNING IN ASSIGNMENTS

Students will be required to push all assignments to GitHub. All writeups will be completed in a separate file called `writeup.md` and feedback will be provided on a file in the assignment called `rubric.md`. Mr. Berg will push back all assignments after regrading on GitHub.

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & AI USE

Professionalism and ethical conduct are essential. While collaboration is encouraged for learning, submit original work unless stated otherwise.

Here's something different: **ChatGPT and other AI tools are allowed and encouraged!** However, you must document how you used them and explain why. This transparency helps you learn while embracing tools that are transforming our industry.

## IN-CLASS EXPECTATIONS

Be an active learner! This means:
- Participating in discussions and asking questions
- Taking notes when appropriate
- Helping classmates when possible
- Reflecting on your learning and addressing gaps
- Attending regularly and punctually

**Classroom rules:**
- Respect yourself, peers, equipment, and the classroom
- Keep phones and devices packed away unless instructed otherwise
  - First offense: Warning
  - Second offense: Parent/guardian email
  - Third offense: Conference and dean referral
- Maintain appropriate noise levels and follow directions

## COMMUNICATION EXPECTATIONS

Check your CPS email regularly for updates and announcements. All student communication must come from CPS-issued email addresses (non-CPS emails won't be answered).

Email etiquette matters: Include appropriate subject lines, salutations, clear content in complete sentences, and signatures. "I didn't check email" isn't an acceptable excuse!
